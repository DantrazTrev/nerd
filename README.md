# NERD: Network-Flow Editor

*Editing living data streams that exist as active network circulation patterns*

## Revolutionary Concept

NERD is a revolutionary editor that operates on files that exist as **living network processes**. These aren't stored files that happen to be distributed - they're active, flowing patterns of data circulation that exist in the movement of network traffic itself. **The file IS the network activity.**

## Core Paradigm Shift

**Traditional Model**: File → Storage → Network Transport → Edit → Store Back  
**NERD Model**: File IS Network Flow → Edit the Flow Pattern Directly

Files exist as:
- Self-sustaining circulation loops in network traffic
- Dynamic routing patterns that carry data
- Living processes made of connection flows
- Patterns that exist in the **movement** itself, not in static storage

## Technical Architecture

### Level 1: Raw Network Interface
- Raw socket programming for packet-level manipulation
- Custom packet formats for flow identification
- Real-time packet injection and modification
- Network interface manipulation

### Level 2: Flow Pattern Management
- Circulation pattern definition and maintenance
- Self-sustaining traffic loops
- Network topology awareness and adaptation
- Flow discovery and coordination

### Level 3: Ed-Compatible Interface
- Traditional text editing commands
- Real-time flow modification
- Network-aware file operations
- Multi-user editing support

## Building NERD

### Prerequisites
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+)
- CMake 3.16+
- Linux kernel with raw socket support
- Root privileges for raw socket access

### Build Instructions
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

### Running NERD
```bash
# Interactive mode
sudo ./nerd

# Open specific flow
sudo ./nerd myflow

# Use specific network interface
sudo ./nerd -i eth0 myflow

# Help
./nerd --help
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Flow Editing
```bash
$ sudo ./nerd myflow
NERD: Network-Flow Editor
Editing living data streams that exist as active network circulation patterns

> append Hello, this is a living network file!
> append It exists as circulating packets in the network.
> print all
1	Hello, this is a living network file!
2	It exists as circulating packets in the network.
> write
Flow written to circulation pattern
> quit
```

### Flow Discovery
```bash
> discover
Discovering existing flows in network...
Found flows: document1, logfile, config
> open document1
Opened flow: document1
> print all
1	This document exists as network circulation
2	Multiple editors can modify it simultaneously
3	No traditional storage - pure network motion
```

### Multi-User Editing
```bash
# User A
$ sudo ./nerd shared_doc
> append User A's contribution

# User B (on different machine)
$ sudo ./nerd shared_doc
> append User B's contribution
> print all
1	User A's contribution
2	User B's contribution
```

## Core Components

### NetworkFlow
Manages active streams and circulation patterns:
```cpp
class NetworkFlow {
    void inject_packet(const RawPacket& packet);
    void modify_flow_pattern(FlowID id, const CirculationPattern& pattern);
    void sustain_circulation();
};
```

### FlowFile
Represents a file as a living network process:
```cpp
class FlowFile {
    void maintain_flow();
    void modify_pattern(const EditCommand& cmd);
    std::string read_from_flow();
    void write_to_flow(const std::string& data);
};
```

### FlowManager
Coordinates multiple active files and network topology:
```cpp
class FlowManager {
    FlowFile* open_flow(const std::string& flow_name);
    void create_circulation_pattern(const std::string& name);
    void sustain_all_flows();
};
```

### FlowEditor
Provides ed-compatible interface:
```cpp
class FlowEditor {
    void append_to_flow(const std::string& line);
    void delete_from_flow(int start, int end);
    void substitute_in_flow(const std::string& pattern, const std::string& replacement);
};
```

## Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. Flow Sustainability
- **Problem**: How to create network traffic patterns that sustain themselves?
- **Solution**: Heartbeat packets and circulation pattern maintenance
- **Implementation**: Automatic packet regeneration and timestamp updates

### 2. Data Encoding
- **Problem**: How is file content encoded in circulation patterns?
- **Solution**: Packet-based content distribution with sequence ordering
- **Implementation**: Content serialization across multiple packets with flow identification

### 3. Flow Discovery
- **Problem**: How do you find and connect to existing flows?
- **Solution**: Broadcast discovery packets and flow registry
- **Implementation**: Network-wide flow announcement and response system

### 4. Edit Propagation
- **Problem**: How do edits propagate through the circulation pattern?
- **Solution**: Edit command packets that modify flow patterns in real-time
- **Implementation**: Immediate packet injection and pattern modification

### 5. Network Efficiency
- **Problem**: How to avoid creating network storms or congestion?
- **Solution**: Rate limiting and intelligent circulation patterns
- **Implementation**: Configurable circulation rates and packet age management

## Network Protocol

### Packet Format
```
[Ethernet Header] [Flow Header] [Payload]
```

### Flow Header
```cpp
struct FlowPacketHeader {
    uint32_t magic;           // "NERD" magic number
    FlowID flow_id;           // Unique flow identifier
    uint32_t sequence;        // Sequence number within flow
    uint32_t packet_type;     // Data, Control, Heartbeat, Edit, Discovery
    uint32_t data_length;     // Payload length
    uint64_t timestamp;       // Flow timing
};
```

### Packet Types
- `FLOW_DATA`: File content packets
- `FLOW_CONTROL`: Flow management commands
- `FLOW_HEARTBEAT`: Circulation maintenance
- `FLOW_EDIT`: Edit command propagation
- `FLOW_DISCOVERY`: Flow discovery and registration

## Success Criteria

- ✅ `nerd myflow` connects to a living data circulation pattern
- ✅ Edits modify the flow pattern in real-time
- ✅ Files survive as long as the circulation pattern is maintained
- ✅ Multiple editors can modify the same flow simultaneously
- ✅ Network disruptions cause flow adaptation, not file loss
- ✅ No traditional storage - the file exists purely in network motion

## Revolutionary Insight

This isn't networked storage or distributed files - it's **computational network traffic**. Files as living processes that exist in the movement of data itself. You're editing the flow patterns of active network circulation, not stored data.

The question isn't "where is the file stored?" but "how is the file circulating?"

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Flow Patterns
- Multi-path circulation for redundancy
- Adaptive routing based on network conditions
- Flow merging and splitting operations

### Enhanced Discovery
- Flow metadata and search capabilities
- Flow versioning and history
- Flow access control and permissions

### Performance Optimizations
- Flow compression and deduplication
- Intelligent packet routing
- Flow caching and acceleration

### Integration
- Traditional file system bridge
- Cloud service integration
- Real-time collaboration features
